would it be better to buy the currency pairs? give me analysis for each of the 20 currency pairs in a tabulated form based on the provided data only. you can provide the buy/sell decision based on a simple analysis done using the Stochastic K and Stochastic D values, along with the Moving Averages (MA) and Keltner Channels (KC) considering the analysis for all timeframes (1min, 5min, 30min, 4hr, and 1day),use an extra column for mentioning the reason for the decision. Please note that for column "KC", the value indicates if there kelter channel crossed over from bottom to upper level in the previous candle (1 indicates crossover from bottom region to upper region of the kelter channel, -1 indicates crossover from upper to lower region and 0 indicates no crossover), "stocastic crossover " value indicates if the stocastic k crossed the stocastic D in the previous candle (1 indicates if the stocastic k crossed above the stocastic D , -1 indicates if the stocastic k crossed below the stocastic D  and 0 indicates no crossover). I have not provided stocastic K values for any timeframe apart from the 1min.
